\section{Sets}
Before we start with the mathematical analysis, we need review some topics of the set theoretic. Lets start by the definition of a general set, after that we'll go define the most important numerical sets. We'll also define what is an ordered set and their consequences as a maximum and minimum elements in its subset and ordering pairs of elements, resulted by the operations with this sets.

A set $\mathcal{S}$ is a collection of objects $x$, which each object has a common property $p$. 
We can take the set of people who has black eyes ($x$ is the people and $p$ is the property "has black eyes" or the set planets which aren't in ours galaxy ($x$ is the planets and $p$ is the property "the planet must be out of our galaxy"). Obviously we have no interest about that kind of sets.

The sets we need study here are collections of mathematical objects, as numbers, functions, sequences, series, metric spaces among others. So, lets take a more formal definition of a set,

\begin{defn}
    Given $\mathcal{S}=\lbrace x\mid x \text{ has a property } p\rbrace$, we say that $\mathcal{S}$ is a set which its elements are all objects $x$ with the property $p$.
\end{defn}

Let $\mathcal{S}$ above, if $x$ has the property $p$, we say that $x$ is an element of $\mathcal{S}$ or, more exactly, $x$ is in $\mathcal{S}$, and we formally write,
\begin{center}
    $x\in\mathcal{S}$
\end{center}

Otherwise, if $x \text{ has no the property} p$, then we say that $x$ is not in $\mathcal{S}$ write,
\begin{center}
    $x\notin\mathcal{S}$
\end{center}

\begin{ex}
Let $x$ be any geometric polygon shapes (triangles, squares, rectangles, \dots) and $S=\lbrace x \mid \text{number of vertices of }x \leq 4\rbrace$, rewrite $\mathcal{S}$ with the name of its elements.

First of all, we need find the elements of $\mathcal{S}$. Then lets do it:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A triangle has $3$ vertices, how $3\leq4$ is true, then triangle $\in \mathcal{S}$.
  \item A square has $4$ vertices, how $4\leq4$ is true, then square $\in \mathcal{S}$.
  \item A rectangle has $4$ vertices, how $4\leq4$ is true, then rectangle $\in \mathcal{S}$.
  \item A trapezium has $4$ vertices, how $4\leq4$ is true, then trapezium $\in \mathcal{S}$.
  \item A parallelogram has $4$ vertices, how $4\leq4$ is true, then parallelogram $\in \mathcal{S}$.
  \item A rhombus has $4$ vertices, how $4\leq4$ is true, then rhombus $\in \mathcal{S}$.
  \item A kite has $4$ vertices, how $4\leq4$ is true, then kite $\in \mathcal{S}$.
  \item A pentagon has $5$ vertices, how $5\leq4$ is false, then pentagon $\notin\mathcal{S}$.
  \item The other polygons has more than 5 vertices, than there isn't any one more element with number of vertices $\leq4$, than they $\notin\mathcal{S}$.
\end{itemize}

That way, we have,
\begin{center}
    $\mathcal{S}=\lbrace\textit{triangle}, \textit{square}, \textit{rectangle}, \textit{trapezium}, \textit{parallelogram}, \textit{rhombus}, \textit{kite}\rbrace$
\end{center}
\end{ex}
The example above shows us that we can describe a set in two ways, generally or specific, the specific way is good to work with sets whose a few elements, for sets with a great number of elements, generally way is more appropriated.

Lets start with numeric sets, the basic mathematical objects. There are many we already know as the natural numbers or integer numbers, also real numbers and complex numbers. We'll begin with the natural numbers.

\begin{defn}
    The natural numbers set is represented by the symbol $\mathbb{N}$, such that its elements starts at number $1$ and the next elements are always the previous element plus $1$ \textit{ad infinitum},
    \begin{center}
        $\mathbb{N}=\lbrace1,(1)+1,(2)+1,(3)+1,(4)+1,\dots\rbrace$
    \end{center}
    This way,
    \begin{center}
        $\mathbb{N}=\lbrace1,2,3,4,5,\dots\rbrace$
    \end{center}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
The set of the integer numbers, which is represented by the capital letter $\mathbb{Z}$, is constructed from $\mathbb{N}$, we must include at the set of the natural numbers the number $0$ and the negative numbers, to do it, just needed subtract $1$ of the first element of the natural numbers and so on, thus
\begin{center}
    $\mathbb{Z}=\lbrace\dots,(-4)-1, (-3)-1, (-2)-1, (-1)-1, (0)-1, (1)-1, \underbrace{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots}_{\mathbb{N}}\rbrace$
\end{center}

Now, its easy to see $\mathbb{Z}$,

\begin{center}
    $\mathbb{Z}=\lbrace\dots, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots\rbrace$
\end{center}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
The set of rational numbers, which is represented by capital letter $\mathbb{Q}$ is composed by fractions like $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integer numbers, with always $q$ different of zero,
\begin{center}
    $\mathbb{Q}=\lbrace p/q\mid p\in\mathbb{Z}, q\in \mathbb{Z}, q\neq0\rbrace$ 
\end{center}
\end{defn}

\section{Ordered Sets}

\begin{defn}
$\mathcal{A}=\lbrace x\mid x \text{ has } p\rbrace$
\end{defn}
